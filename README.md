Some kind of plants requires to grow in a special conditions. A lemon tree needed in a lot of sunlight, air temperature is around (15-25C) and middle value of humidity. A coffee tree requires the similar conditions. This is why I made this project. The Growhome 2.0 project can help you to control conditions of growing. The DHT22 sensor measures air temperature and humidity. Waterproof DS18B20 and Moisture Sensor v1.2 measures soil temperature and humidity.

If the soil humidity is less than required, relay turns on the water pump that makes soil more humid. When the soil humidity is more than required, relay turns off the water pump.

So we can say that Growhome 2.0 has auto watering system, this is the main feature of a new version of Growhome.

TFT LCD displays all the information about air humidity, air temperature, soil humidity, soil temperature. 

In this Instructable, I'll help you to assemble your own Growhome v2.0
